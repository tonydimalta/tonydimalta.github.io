Hey! I'm Tony, a Gameplay Programmer at Wushu Studios.
I worked on every major platform on mobile, PC and console, and as the time of writing shipped 3 games, including one on next-gen consoles.
The content of this site will include guides, best practices and more.
I hope you'll find it useful in your journey.
